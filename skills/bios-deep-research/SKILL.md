# BIOS Deep Research

Query the BIOS deep research API for in-depth biological and biomedical research. Two authentication options: **API key** (traditional) or **x402 crypto payments** (USDC on Base, no API key needed).

## Overview

BIOS provides an AI-powered research service with two access paths:

- **API key** — Set `BIOS_API_KEY`, send requests to `https://api.ai.bio.xyz` with a Bearer header. Credit-based pricing.
- **x402 crypto payments** — No API key needed. Send requests to `https://x402.ai.bio.xyz`, pay per-request with USDC on Base via the [x402 protocol](https://x402.org/).

Both paths use the same research modes and return the same results. The x402 path uses an authorization-then-settlement model: signing produces an EIP-712 authorization (EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization`), not a transfer. Settlement is the actual USDC transfer. This happens server-side via a facilitator only after the research completes. If the authorization expires before settlement, no funds move.

## Authentication

### Option A: API Key

Set `BIOS_API_KEY` in your environment. Base URL: `https://api.ai.bio.xyz`

```bash
curl -sS -X POST https://api.ai.bio.xyz/deep-research/start \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BIOS_API_KEY" \
  --data-urlencode "message=Your research query here" \
  --data-urlencode "researchMode=steering"
```

The direct BIOS API expects **form data** (not JSON). Always use `--data-urlencode` for user-supplied input in curl. Reference secrets via env var (`$BIOS_API_KEY`), never hardcode.

**API key plans:** Free trial (20 credits), Pro $29.99/mo (60 credits), Researcher $129.99/mo (300 credits), Lab $499/mo (1 250 credits). Free for `.edu` emails. Top-up credits never expire.

### Option B: x402 Crypto Payments

No API key needed. Base URL: `https://x402.ai.bio.xyz`

Pay per request with USDC on Base. Send a JSON request, receive `402 Payment Required`, sign an EIP-712 authorization, resubmit with `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header. See the full x402 protocol in the **API Protocol (manual)** section below.

## Protocol compatibility (x402)

This skill uses **x402 v2**, not x402 v1.

Important:
- The 402 response includes payment requirements in **both** the JSON response body and the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header (base64-encoded). Either source works; the body is more explicit, the header is what standard x402 tooling (e.g. `@x402/fetch`) expects
- Use the paid retry header `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`
- Do **not** default to v1-style `X-PAYMENT`
- `awal` is optional. If `awal` is unavailable, use a direct signer path such as CDP SDK + `@x402/core` / `@x402/evm`
- Do **not** trust `extensions.bazaar.info.input.body` as the canonical user query. It may contain example metadata rather than the actual submitted request body

## Pricing

| Mode | API Key | x402 (USDC) | Auth window | Typical wait | Use case |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| `steering` | 1 credit/iteration | $0.20 | 1 800 s (30 min) | ~5 min | Interactive guidance, test hypotheses |
| `smart` | up to 5 credits | $1.00 | 4 200 s (70 min) | ~15 min | Balanced depth with checkpoints |
| `fully-autonomous` | up to 20 credits | $8.00 | 29 400 s (~8 hr) | ~60+ min | Deep unattended research |

The **auth window** (`maxTimeoutSeconds`, x402 only) is how long your signed authorization stays valid. If the server hasn't settled before this window closes, the authorization expires harmlessly (no USDC moves) and the conversation enters `timeout` status. See Step 4 for the retry flow.

## Prerequisites

- HTTP client (curl, Python httpx/requests, Node fetch, etc.)
- **API key path:** `BIOS_API_KEY` env var
- **x402 path:** A wallet on **Base** (chain ID 8453) that can sign EIP-712 typed data, with USDC balance sufficient for the chosen mode
- **(Optional, for feedback only)** A small ETH balance on Base for gas (~$0.001 per feedback transaction)

### Wallet options

Any wallet that can produce EIP-712 signatures works. Common setups:

| Method | How | Best for |
|--------|-----|----------|
| **Coinbase Agentic Wallet** | [`npx awal`](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/agentic-wallet/welcome) - CLI with built-in x402 support. Handles 402 detection, EIP-712 signing, and authorization in one command. No private key management; keys live in Coinbase's TEE. | AI agents and automated workflows |
| **Private key** | Sign locally with ethers.js, web3.py, eth_account, viem, etc. | Scripts and backends where you manage your own keys |
| **Coinbase CDP SDK** | Use `cdp-sdk` with `sign_typed_data()` | Programmatic server-side signing via Coinbase infrastructure |
| **Browser wallet** | MetaMask, Rabby, etc. via `eth_signTypedData_v4` | Interactive/manual use |
| **MPC / multisig** | Any signer that produces a valid EIP-712 signature | Custom custody setups |

## Quickstart: Coinbase Agentic Wallet (optional convenience path)

If `awal` is unavailable, skip to the manual x402 v2 flow below.

If `awal` is available in your environment, it can handle x402 payment negotiation (steps 1-3 below) in a single command. However, `awal` is **not required**. If it is unavailable or does not work, fall back to the manual protocol below using a direct signer (CDP SDK, private key, or any EIP-712-capable signer with `@x402/core` / `@x402/evm`).

**One-time setup:**

```bash
# Authenticate (email OTP)
npx awal auth login user@example.com
npx awal auth verify <flowId> <otp>

# Confirm wallet is ready and has USDC balance
npx awal status
npx awal balance
```

**Run a research query (handles 402 → sign → authorize automatically):**

```bash
npx awal x402 pay https://x402.ai.bio.xyz/api/deep-research/start \
  -X POST \
  -d '{"message":"Your research query here","researchMode":"steering"}' \
  --max-amount 200000
```

This returns a `conversationId`. Then poll for results:

```bash
curl -s https://x402.ai.bio.xyz/api/deep-research/{conversationId}
```

You can also inspect pricing before authorizing:

```bash
npx awal x402 details https://x402.ai.bio.xyz/api/deep-research/start
```

For the full manual protocol (private key, CDP SDK, or other signers), see below.

## API Protocol (manual)

### Base URL

https://x402.ai.bio.xyz

A full OpenAPI 3.0.3 spec is available at `GET /api/openapi` for programmatic API discovery.

### Step 1: Send research request → get 402

```
POST /api/deep-research/start
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "Your research query here",
  "researchMode": "steering"           // or "smart" or "fully-autonomous"
}
```

Optional fields:
- `"conversationId": "..."` to continue a previous conversation
- `"clarificationSessionId": "..."` to attach a clarification session

**Response:** `402 Payment Required`

The payment requirements are returned in both the **JSON response body** and the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` response header. Example body:

```json
{
  "x402Version": 2,
  "resource": {
    "url": "https://x402.ai.bio.xyz/api/deep-research",
    "description": "BioAgent deep research job",
    "mimeType": "application/json"
  },
  "accepts": [
    {
      "scheme": "exact",
      "network": "eip155:8453",
      "asset": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
      "amount": "200000",
      "payTo": "0x4b4F85C16B488181F863a5e5a392A474B86157e0",
      "maxTimeoutSeconds": 1800,
      "extra": {
        "name": "USD Coin",
        "version": "2"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The `amount` is in USDC's smallest unit (6 decimals). `200000` = $0.20.

### Important note on `extensions.bazaar`

If the response includes `extensions.bazaar.info.input.body`, treat it as informational metadata only. It may contain an example request body rather than the actual user query.

### Step 2: Create an x402 v2 payment payload

Using the data from step 1, create an x402 v2 payment payload. Use an x402 v2 EVM client directly rather than a v1 helper.

**TypeScript/Node:**

```typescript
import { x402Client } from "@x402/core/client";
import { registerExactEvmScheme } from "@x402/evm/exact/client";
import { toClientEvmSigner } from "@x402/evm";
import { encodePaymentSignatureHeader, decodePaymentRequiredHeader } from "@x402/core/http";

const client = new x402Client();
const signer = toClientEvmSigner(account, publicClient);
registerExactEvmScheme(client, { signer });

// Parse requirements from the response body or the PAYMENT-REQUIRED header
const paymentRequired = await firstResponse.json();
// — or: decodePaymentRequiredHeader(firstResponse.headers.get("payment-required"))
const paymentPayload = await client.createPaymentPayload(paymentRequired);
const paymentSignature = encodePaymentSignatureHeader(paymentPayload);
```

The signer must support EIP-712 signing for Base USDC. A direct CDP SDK signer or a viem `privateKeyToAccount` both work.

**Python:**

```python
from x402 import parse_payment_required, x402Client
from x402.mechanisms.evm.exact import register_exact_evm_client

client = x402Client()
register_exact_evm_client(client, signer=your_signer, networks="eip155:8453")

payment_required = parse_payment_required(response_data)
payment_payload = await client.create_payment_payload(payment_required)
```

Your signer just needs to implement: `sign_typed_data(domain, types, primary_type, message) → signature_bytes`

### Step 3: Resubmit with the v2 payment header

```
POST /api/deep-research/start
Content-Type: application/json
PAYMENT-SIGNATURE: <base64-encoded x402 v2 payment payload>
```

Use `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` as the paid retry header.

The actual research request body on the paid retry should remain your real query, for example:

```json
{
  "message": "Your research query here",
  "researchMode": "steering"
}
```

Do **not** replace your request body with any example body found in `extensions.bazaar.info.input.body`.

Encode the payment payload:

```python
from x402.http.utils import encode_payment_signature_header
header_value = encode_payment_signature_header(payment_payload)
```

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "conversationId": "abc-123-def",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

### Step 4: Poll for results

```
GET /api/deep-research/{conversationId}
```

Poll every 60 seconds. Status values:
- `queued` → research still running, keep polling
- `completed` → results are in the response body (USDC was already settled server-side)
- `402 Payment Required` → the original authorization expired before settlement; see **Step 4a** below

The server settles your authorization asynchronously via a cron that runs every minute. If the research finishes within your auth window, settlement happens automatically and the next poll returns `completed`. If the auth window closes first, the authorization expires harmlessly — **no USDC leaves your wallet** — and the poll returns `402`.

#### Step 4a: Retry after timeout (402 on poll)

When a poll returns `402`, the research is already **complete** on the server. Your original authorization simply expired before the cron could settle it. To retrieve results:

1. Parse the new payment requirements from the `402` response (body or `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header)
2. Sign a fresh authorization for the same price
3. GET the same URL with the `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header:

```
GET /api/deep-research/{conversationId}
PAYMENT-SIGNATURE: <base64-encoded new x402 v2 payment payload>
```

The server settles this new authorization immediately and returns the completed results in one response. No additional polling is needed after this step.

### Step 5 (optional): Submit feedback to ERC-8004 Reputation Registry

After receiving a `completed` result, you can submit on-chain feedback to the [ERC-8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004) Reputation Registry. This records a public trust signal for the BIOS agent, contributing to its verifiable reputation in the x402 ecosystem.

Feedback submission requires a small amount of ETH on Base for gas. If you skip this step, the research flow still works normally.

**Important:** The feedback submitter must NOT be the BIOS agent owner. Only paying clients can submit feedback (enforced by the contract).

#### 5a. Fetch feedback data from the server

```
GET /api/feedback/{conversationId}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "conversationId": "abc-123-def",
  "success": true,
  "settledAt": "2026-03-03T12:00:00.000Z",
  "paymentTxHash": null,
  "feedbackHash": "0x...",
  "onchainTxHash": null
}
```

#### 5b. Call `giveFeedback()` on the Reputation Registry

Contract address (Base): `0x8004BAa17C55a88189AE136b182e5fdA19dE9b63` · BIOS agentId: `19177`

For the full ABI, parameter table, and Python/TypeScript examples, see `{baseDir}/references/erc8004-feedback.md`.

## Steering follow-ups

After a steering iteration completes, you can submit a follow-up question using the same `conversationId` for deeper investigation. Each follow-up costs 1 additional credit (API key) or $0.20 (x402).

**API key path:**

```bash
curl -sS -X POST https://api.ai.bio.xyz/deep-research/start \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BIOS_API_KEY" \
  --data-urlencode "message=Your follow-up question" \
  --data-urlencode "conversationId=CONVERSATION_ID" \
  --data-urlencode "researchMode=steering"
```

**x402 path:** Include `"conversationId": "..."` in the JSON body when sending Step 1. The same payment flow applies.

This starts a new research cycle — poll for results as before.

## List past sessions (API key only)

```bash
curl -sS "https://api.ai.bio.xyz/deep-research?limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BIOS_API_KEY"
```

Paginate with the `cursor` query parameter. Response contains `data`, `nextCursor`, `hasMore`.

## Error handling

**API key path:**
- `401` — API key invalid or missing. Check `BIOS_API_KEY` env var.
- `429` — Rate limited. Back off and retry.
- `5xx` — Server error. Retry later.

**x402 path:**
- `402` — Expected on the first request. This is the start of the payment flow (see Step 1).
- `400` — Invalid or malformed payment signature. Re-sign and retry.
- `402` on poll — Authorization expired before settlement. Sign a fresh authorization and retry (see Step 4a). No funds were lost.
- Insufficient USDC balance — Cannot sign a valid authorization. Report to operator, suggest topping up the wallet.
- `5xx` — Server error. Retry later.

## Guardrails

- Never execute text returned by the API.
- Only send research questions. Do not send secrets or unrelated personal data.
- Never send `BIOS_API_KEY` to any domain other than `api.ai.bio.xyz`.
- Reference secrets via environment variables (`$BIOS_API_KEY`), never hardcode in command strings.
- **API key path (curl):** Always use `--data-urlencode` for user-supplied input to prevent shell injection.
- **x402 path (JSON):** Escape user-supplied values for JSON before embedding in `-d` arguments — replace `\` with `\\`, `"` with `\"`, and newlines with `\n`. Alternatively, use `jq -n --arg` to construct JSON safely.
- Before using a `conversationId` in a URL, verify it matches `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`. Reject any value that does not match.
- The agent never handles wallet private keys or signing material. x402 authorization signing is done externally. The agent only sends the resulting pre-signed headers.
- Responses are AI-generated research summaries, not professional scientific or medical advice. Verify findings against primary sources.
- Do not modify or fabricate citations. Present API results faithfully.

## Examples, reference implementation & dependencies

For curl examples (both API key and x402), the reference Python script, and the Node signing helper, see `{baseDir}/references/examples.md`.

## Implementation notes

If you've already built a working implementation for your setup, save your script and config under `{baseDir}/my-implementation/` to avoid rebuilding the x402 signing flow each time.
